tips for git:

always run 'git pull' before 'git commit' to avoid code conflicts, especially when changing data.sql, schema-*.sql and WindycityflyersApplication.java file,


the code contains 4 parts:
	1.data/entity classes with relations and put them in `model` package
	2.sql statements that create responding tables from #1 and put them in schema.sql)
	3.add some data via sql statements and put them in data.sql.
	4.create repository classes and put them in `repository` package(Optional ?)


order_status:
	1.pending_payment
	2.paid/confirmed
	3.waiting for pickup by runner
	4.picked up & delivering
	5.delivered
	7.delivery failed & re-deliver
	8.canceled
