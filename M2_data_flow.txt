tips for git:

always run 'git pull' before 'git commit' to avoid code conflicts, especailly when changing data.sql and schema-*.sql file,


the code contains 4 parts:
	1.data/entity classes with relations and put them in `model` package
	2.sql statements that create responding tables from #1 and put them in schema.sql)
	3.add some data via sql statements and put them in data.sql, for nosql data initialization
	4. create repository classes and put them in `repository` package(Optional ?)


order_status:
	pending_payment
	paid/confirmed
	picked up & delivering
	delivered
	

new table: order_product
	eg:
	product_A  		2
	product_B		3
	product_C		1
	items of product
	

	


product-> shopping chart -> order, shopping chart should be (relational sql) not nosql

admin-> CRUD stores

admin-> CRUD product, each product belongs to a store
